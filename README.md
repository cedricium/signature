<h3 align="center">Medium signatures, simplified.</h3>

Signature :writing_hand: is a browser extension (for Chrome and Firefox) that saves writers and editors of Medium.com time from having to copy and paste their blog's signature / sign-off by providing a native inline-tooltip button on Medium that pastes the signature in a single click of the button.

Take the following sign-off for example:

>Happy coding!
>
>â€“ Quincy Larson, teacher at [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org)
>
>If you get value out of these emails, please consider [supporting our nonprofit](https://donate.freecodecamp.org/).

Quincy Larson, the "teacher and guy who started it [freeCodeCamp]", used this at the end of all of his blog posts for a while. Rather than him needing to type that every time or copy and paste it from another blog post, Quincy would be able to just press the signature button on Medium and his sign-off would be pasted for him instantly.

Let's see how it works!
